<h2>How to market Handshake, A community effort.</h2>

<div class="row">

    <p> How you the user can help spread awareness of HNS is simple it doesn’t need to a be a long daunting marketing strategy or anything remotely complexed it can be as small sending out a tweet or telling your friend about HNS simply talking about HNS is more than ample in individual efforts, It may seem insignificant but collectively as a community would greatly accelerate the growth and adoption of HNS.</p>
    
    <p>Iterating on the example stated earlier a straightforward and effective method of community marketing that is already in effect would be utilizing social sites like Twitter. There is at present a small group of individuals within the HNS community that put out tweets relating to HNS with the $HNS tag, This tag is essentially a brand, It must be treated as one. Whenever someone unfamiliar to HNS sees a tweet with that tag we want them to click on it and find tweets and articles or useful information promoting them to get involved with HNS, what we don’t want is random unorganized, uninformative tweets filling the space and bocking potential user from graining an understanding in that brief moment we have their attention
