    <p>I t might be as well to point out in mathematical language - for
those readers to whom it appeals - the reason for this
enormous sensitivity to changes in the level step or temperature, and to add a few physical remarks of a similar kind.
The reason is that the time of expectation, call it t, depends on
the ratio W/kTby an exponential function, thus
t == re W/
kT.</p>

  <div class="column">
   
    <p> is a certain small constant of the order of 10- 13 or 10-14 S .
Now, this particular exponential function is not an accidental
feature. I t recurs again and again in the statistical theory of
heat, forming, as it were, its backbone. I t is a measure of the
improbability of an energy amount as large as W gathering
accidentally in some particular part of the system, and it is
this improbability which increases so enormously when a
considerable multiple ofthe 'average energy' kTis required</p>
