    <h2>How to market Handshake, A community effort.</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    
    
    <p> How you the user can help spread awareness of HNS is simple it doesn’t need to a be a long daunting marketing strategy or anything remotely complexed it can be as small sending out a tweet or telling your friend about HNS simply talking about HNS is more than ample in individual efforts, It may seem insignificant but collectively as a community would greatly accelerate the growth and adoption of HNS.</p>
    
    <p>Iterating on the example stated earlier a straightforward and effective method of community marketing that is already in effect would be utilizing social sites like Twitter. There is at present a small group of individuals within the HNS community that put out tweets relating to HNS with the $HNS tag, This tag is essentially a brand, It must be treated as one. Whenever someone unfamiliar to HNS sees a tweet with that tag we want them to click on it and find tweets and articles or useful information promoting them to get involved with HNS, what we don’t want is random unorganized, uninformative tweets filling the space and bocking potential user from graining an understanding in that brief moment we have their attention </p>
    
    <p>     What can we do about this? Once more all you need to do is a simple task, Like and retweet the useful informative tweets within the $HNS tag thus promoting     these tweets. Every day if you possess the free time just scroll through the $HNS tag and help promote those which shine a positive light on HNS. This by no means      is an effort to dictate what people see and read about HNS as the advocation for censorship goes agents the HNS model and what it represents but simply a way to      support the growth of the user base by promoting informative and useful information. 

</p>

  <div class="column">
   
    <p> The outcome of a combined community effort that we hope to see would be to excite developers about the potential of HNS, and the limitless possibilities of       use cases HNS has to offer, as well as getting new users to join the ecosystem and claim there user handle/identity and possibly do as I have done today and build      a small personal website.
     While on this topic I would love to shout out a member of the HNS community and a product they are currently working on, An effortless way to setup and host a       fully decentralized domain http://app.sinpapeles/ For any new users who are struggling to setup a site with HNS this will dramatically aid those who need it </p>
